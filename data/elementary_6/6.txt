Once upon a time, three little pigs are sent out into the world by their mother to build their own houses. The first little pig builds a house of straw, but a wolf blows it down. The second pig builds a house of sticks, but the wolf blows his house down, too. The first and second little pigs run to the third little pig. The third little pigâ€™s house is built of hard bricks. The wolf tries to go into the house through a chimney, but the third little pig outsmarts him. He puts a pot of boiling water under the chimney and the wolf plunges into it. The wolf runs away. Ever since then the three little pigs live happily and safely.
