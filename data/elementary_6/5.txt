A long time ago, in a happy Hopi village, there lived a little boy. One day a band of fierce Navaho Indians swooped down and took him away. They carried him to their camp, where the squaws took his shirt and moccasins away, and gave them to the Chief's son. Then they made the boy work all day. Near the Navaho camp was a high bluff on which lived a kind-hearted Hawk. It often flew over the camp, and saw the boy working hard. One day, when all the Navahos were gathered together at the Chief's lodge, the Hawk flew down and snatched the boy. The bird flew to the high bluff, and put down the boy, then it went back to the camp. It swooped down on the Chief's little son, and pulling off his embroidered shirt, carried it to the boy. The Hawk fed him some food. After that it took him on its back and flew with him back to his mother.
