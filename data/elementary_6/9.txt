Momotarō came to Earth inside a giant peach, which was found floating down a river by an old, childless woman. The woman and her husband discovered the child when they tried to open the peach to eat it. The child explained that he had been sent by Heaven to be their son. The couple named him Momotarō. Years later, Momotarō left his parents to fight a band of demons on a distant island.
