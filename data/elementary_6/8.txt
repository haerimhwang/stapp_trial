Once upon a time, a woman is eaten by a tiger on her way home. The tiger disguised himself as the woman wearing her clothes and goes to her children to eat them as well. The children pray to the sky to give them a rope to escape from the tiger. They go up to the sky by climbing the rope. The tiger also prays to get a rope, but because the rope is rotten, the tiger falls to the earth and dies. The brother and sister who go up to the sky become the sun and the moon.
